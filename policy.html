Security and Data Retention</h2>

We use Security Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to encrypt Personal data (such as your payment information) before it travels over the internet. Credit card numbers are never stored on our database or servers.
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to log off when finished using a shared computer.</p>
<p>We will promptly notify those persons whose Personal data is compromised. Notwithstanding, GameCredits does not accept liability for any unintentional disclosure or a disclosure that occurs due to a security breach of our systems or facilities.
When determining the retention periods, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrolment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.</p>
